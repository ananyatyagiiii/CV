  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>BSc (Hons) Physics and Mathematics student at the University of Manchester (2024–2027) with a strong interest in theoretical physics, astrophysics, and problem-solving. I excel at analytical thinking, breaking down complex problems, and applying theoretical concepts to real-world situations.</p>

  <p>I enjoy research and hands-on STEM projects, and I am comfortable working both independently and in collaborative environments. I have a keen eye for detail, a creative approach to challenges, and the ability to communicate ideas clearly, whether through writing, presentations, or mentoring.</p>

  <p>Beyond academics, I am passionate about community engagement and nurturing young talent in STEM, combining leadership, curiosity, and perseverance in everything I do.</p>
